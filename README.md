# twitter-airline-sentiment-analysis
Our group project for IS392, AI Text-Driven Analytics, involves developing a language processing model to predict the sentiment of a given Twitter user.


To use the model, ensure that the Tweets.csv file is in the same directory as the Python script, or else the script won't be able to locate the csv file.
